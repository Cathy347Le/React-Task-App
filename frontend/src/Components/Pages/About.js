      <h1>This is the About page</h1>
      <h2>Hello, my name is Cathy Le.</h2>
      <p>
        I am a full stack software engineer, and formerly a political research
        data analyst at Greenberg Quinlan Rosner, which is a prestigious
        political polling and consulting firm in Washington, DC. As a software
        engineer, I enjoy breaking down complex problems and presenting simple
        user-friendly solutions. Technology should be enjoyable and easy to use!
        Similar to the tech industry, the polling industry relies on good
        coordination. I take pride in knowing how to work with people of
        different skillsets, personalities, and backgrounds to accomplish the
        task at hand. While I excel at solving problems on my own, I am most
        fulfilled when collaborating with others to find solutions. I believe
        accomplishments and success are better experienced when you get to share
        them with others. When I’m not coding, I’m probably walking my dog Gouda
        or out with friends at a biergarten.
