# React Task Tracker

### Files install

readme.md, .gitignore, bootstrap, sass

### Create a header component

- Create a components folder -> Header.js
- Create a functional component
- Add Button - add new task

### Create a button component

- Add background color and text prop
- Add default props (ignore propTypes for now)

### Create Task List Component

- Create 3 Tasks and render the title
- Add key prop to task items
- Convert taskList to "state" data via useState
  `const [tasks, setTasks] = useState();`
- Since you want other components to access the task state data, it is recommend you <strong>lift the state up</strong>. Have the app.js management the data and have it passed down to other components. Once of the toughest thing for a junior is understanding which component should manage the state.

### Create Task Component

- Create a task component (name, title, date);
- Add X close icon to task item
  `npm i react-icons`
- When you want to delete a task (hitting the X button), that takes happens in the task component, but the state is managed in the app component. What needs to be done is the event (delete) needs to be raised and have app.js handle the event. Method is onDelete and handleDelete.
  - Create handleDelete on app.js - just console.log for now for testing purposes
  - Pass that down to , with the property called onDelete
  - When the X close is hit in the task component `onClick = {onDelete}`, the default info that will console is the event info
    - If you want to pass the task.id, instead of calling onDelete directly, you call a function reference that runs onDelete and passes in the task.id
    - If the console.log works and displayed the id, update the handleDelete method to remove the task selected
    ```
    const handleDelete = (id) => {
    setTasks(tasks.filter((task) => task.id !== id));
    };
    ```
    - Conditional render: add a message when there are no more tasks
    - If you wanted to do inline stlying
      ```
      <p className="no-tasks-msg" style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>
      ```
- Add a completed functionality

  - Create handleToggleCompleted and onToggleCompleted and console.log the event and id
  - Also render class dynamically to change task border color - see code in task.js for diff ways of doing this

  ### Add New Task Form

  - Get simple form to display - task title, task date, and submit button
  - useState to manage form data. Set completed property to default to false.
    - on the form inputs, need to add a value and onChange property. value is whatever user types in and captured into the variable data. onChange, a controlled component will fire when there is data in the value property. onChange will directly call setTitle and setDay to update the state.
    - You can check this is working on React Dev Tools, see state data get updated with user inserts text in the input value

- Add New Task when submit button is clicked, done on App.js where state is managed. handleAddTask and onAddTask and onSubmit
  - Include form validation
  - Add task title and date and check that the data console log correctly.
  - Update handleAddTask method to add the new task in the state
    - React will create a unique key id for the new task? I guess not.
    - Use spread operator to add in the new Task

#### Add Feature - Toggle Add Form

- Add useState on App.js to toggle the form - showAddTaskForm, setshowAddTaskForm
  - In app.js update how Add task from renders.
  ```
  {showAddTaskForm && <AddTask onAddTask={handleAddTask} />}
  ```
  - You can test the logic above by manually updating the intial useState to true or false
  - Create methods to update the toggle functionality onShowAddTaskForm, handleShowAddTaskForm
  - Add conditional rendering to the Add New Task button.
    - Add New Task purple button changes to Hide Task Form orange

#### Add Delete All Task Button

- Reuse button component and create methods handleDeleteAllTask and onDeleteAllTask
- Console.log method to check plumbing
- update handleDeleteAllTask to clear all the tasks `setTasks(tasks.length === 0);`

### ROUTING

#### Version 5

- Install react-router old version , not v6 `npm i react-router-dom@5.2.0`
- Add a NavBar in the header component
- Add `import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from "react-router-dom";` in app.js
- Add About and Notes page component
- In app.js wrap everything in <Router></Router> and then add your Route paths
- To bypass page reload, replace anchor links with <Link> component in NavBar.js
- Make Add New Task Button only appear on the homepage (not About or Notes page)
  - useLocation from react-router-dom in header.js
  - useLocation gives you access to useLocation.pathname (renamed to location)

#### Version 6

- Stable version released in early Jan. Updating to version 6 will break your React app
- Install `npm i react-router-dom@6`
- Wrap <Route> with <Routes>. Replace component={About} with element={<About/>} which takes JSX nw

- Common differences are:
  - <Switch> doesnâ€™t exist anymore. Replaced with <Routes> and you have to wrap your routes with <Routes>
  - No more rendering components or passing props to the rendering component in <Route> with component and render anymore. Both are replaced by a single element prop which takes in JSX. So instead of component={Home} will be element={<Home/>}
  - No need for the keyword exact anymore
  - Only <Route> are allowed in <Routes>. No other children tags are allowed
  - Redirect replaced with Navigate and useHistory is now useNavigate
